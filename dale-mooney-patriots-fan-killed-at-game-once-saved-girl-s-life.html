As the two or three big waves came up, I told her, ‘Hold your breath, hold your breath.’ And then boom, the wave would hit us,” Mooney said.</p><p>“Then we’d fight to stand up and she tried to stand up. She was slipping and sliding.”</p><p>Mooney, who was 6 feet 3, told the girl to jump onto his shoulders during a short break between the crashing waves.</p><p>“We went for it and got hit by the next two or three rounds trying to get back,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Mooney got into an altercation with Miami Dolphins fans during Sunday’s game at Gillette Stadium that left him dead. <span class=credit>Brian Looney via WJAR</span></figure><p>Mooney was eventually able to make it back to shore with the young girl in tow.</p><p>Beachgoers who witnessed the daring rescue applauded him, and one stranger shook his hand, he said.</p><p>“I had a few people come up to me as I came out to tell me, ‘That was one of the bravest things I’ve ever seen’ and whatnot. So I felt pretty good about it,” he said.</p><p>Mooney never learned the child’s name, but she thanked him for helping her to safety before she ran over to family members.</p><p>The New Hampshire father said he suffered bruised ribs, cut shins and swollen knees from the rescue and was “very sore” the next day.</p><p>He had been at the beach with his son when he noticed the young girl struggling, and said he hoped he could learn from the experience.</p><p>“We’ve, of course, told him not to be foolish and put yourself in dangerous situations. Or at least his mom has,” he told the outlet with a laugh.</p><p>“Don’t be a hero like your dad because you could get in dangerous situations.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A witness in the stands told MassLive that he saw Mooney — who was at the game with three friends — get into a physical confrontation with other men before a Dolphins fan walked over and slugged him. <span class=credit>Brian Looney via WJAR</span></figure><p>About 14 years later, Mooney tragically found himself in a dangerous situation that didn’t have a happy ending when he got into an altercation with Miami Dolphins fans during Sunday’s game at Gillette Stadium.</p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Keep up with today's most important news</h3><p class=inline-module__cta>Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.</p><p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Thanks for signing up!</h3></p><p>A witness in the stands told MassLive that he saw Mooney — who was at the game with three friends — <a href=#>get into a physical confrontation with other men</a> before a Dolphins fan walked over and slugged him.</p><p>“The Dolphins fan walks over and clearly punches him in the face,” Joey Kilmartin of Nashua, New Hampshire,&nbsp;told the local outlet.</p><p>“[He] gets knocked out and you can tell right away he’s not OK.”</p><p>Mooney never regained consciousness.</p><p>EMTs performed CPR and rushed him to Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, where he was pronounced dead shortly before midnight.</p><p>His death has left his wife, Lisa, <a href=#>feeling numb and confused</a>, she said.</p><p>“I want to know what happened.
