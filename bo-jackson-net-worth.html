He is best known for being the only athlete named as an All Star in two popular sports. During his career, Bo has won such awards as the Heisman Trophy, Chic Harley Award, Walter Camp Award and others. In addition to his career as an athlete Bo has also appeared in several shows and films, and has been involved in the making of some video games. Although Jackson does not play anymore, he is still a very active person and participates in many projects and is a part of several organizations.</p><p>So how rich is Bo Jackson? It has been estimated that Bo’s net worth is $16 million. This sum might also change in the future, as Jackson is still involved in many activities.</p><h3>Bo Jackson Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Vincent Edward Jackson, better known as Bo Jackson, was born in 1962, in Alabama. Jackson studied at McAdory High School and there started playing baseball. Later, he continued his studies at Auburn University, where he chose a football scholarship. Despite this fact, Bo still continued playing baseball while studying at college and proved that he is was a really talented athlete. Bo also played football very well, and was a part of “Auburn Tigers” football team and set several SEC records. He was even named the Most Valuable Player and this made him even more acclaimed. This was also the time when Bo Jackson’s net worth began growing.</p><p>In 1986 Bo became a part of the baseball team called the “Kansas City Royals”. This also added a lot to Jackson’s net worth. He was one of the best players of the team and with every game became even more professional. Later Bo was also a part of such baseball teams as the “California Angels” and “Chicago White Sox”. There he was also able to show his best skills, and of course increase his net worth.</p><p>As mentioned before, Bo was not only good at baseball, but also at football. Although at first Bo wanted to focus on baseball, in 1987 he finally agreed to become a part of the team called the “Los Angeles Raiders”. This also had a huge impact on the growth of Bo Jackson’s net worth. Unfortunately, Bo experienced an injury and was unable to play for some time. His injury had an effect on both of his career as a football player and also as a baseball player. Finally, Bo decided to retire and focus on other activities.</p><p>As imentioned, Bo was involved in the making of such video games as “Bo Jackson’s Hit and Run”, “Tecmo Bowl”, “NFL Street 2”. This also made Jackson’s net worth grow. What is more, Bo appeared in such shows and movies as “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”, “The Pandora Project”, “Married….with Children” and others. Undoubtedly, these appearances also added to Bo Jackson’s net worth.</p><p>All in all, it could be said that Bo Jackson is considered to be one of the most successful athletes and there is also a chance that Bo’s net worth will become higher in the future.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.707407407407><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bo Jackson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 30, 1962 (age 52</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bessemer, Alabama, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>230 lbs (104.33 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player, American football player, Businessperson, Actor, Athlete</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Auburn University, McAdory High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Linda Jackson (m. 1987)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Morgan Jackson, Nicholas Jackson, Garrett Jackson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Florence Bond, A.D.
