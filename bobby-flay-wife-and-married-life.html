However, Flay appears to have a confusing love life. The man is still looking for a fulfilling relationship after having many unsuccessful marriages.</strong></p><p>Stephanie March was Flay’s third wife out of his three marriages. So why is the seasoned reality TV star’s romantic life so erratic? Additionally, find out whether Flay is currently seeing someone.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_The_First_Wife_of_Bobby_Flay_They_Had_Two_Years_of_Marriage>Who Is The First Wife of Bobby Flay? They Had Two Years of Marriage</span></h2><p>Debra Ponzek, Flay’s first wife, is an American cook as well. She enrolled at Boston University to study engineering originally, but she eventually left school. She thereafter studied at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, where she is currently enjoying a successful career in the culinary arts.</p><p>On May 11, 1991, the pair was married. The Rainbow Room, a well-known NYC hotspot, served as the venue for their wedding ceremony. It was also around this time that their professions as cooks were beginning to flourish.</p><p>A crowd of 225 people saw the pair go down the aisle, including chefs Larry Forgione and Jonathan Waxman. In Anguilla, they enjoyed their honeymoon.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_The_Two_Initially_Connect_Their_Unwavering_Passion_for_Cooking>How Did The Two Initially Connect? Their Unwavering Passion for Cooking</span></h2><p>Bobby Flay and Ponzek initially came into contact in June 1990 while Flay was employed at the East Village’s Miracle Grill, a casual dining establishment. The two got to know one another in the same year that they were employed by the nonprofit Meals on Wheels.</p><p>Later, he brought five of Debra’s friends, along with his then-future wife, to the Miracle Grill. Flay was employed there as the head chef. To wow her, he prepared a lavish dinner in addition to many other things.</p><p>A few months of dating preceded the couple’s engagement. In 1992, they were both nominated for the James Beard Award as Rising Star Chefs. But Ponzek took home the major prize.</p><p>Bobby was given the same award a year later, and then two more. They had amazing chemistry together, but in 1993 they got divorced. Currently, she and Greg Addonizio are wed.</p><p>Bobby Flay and Kate Connelly had a daughter together during their second marriage.</p><p>On October 1, 1995, Bobby Flay wed Kate Connelly, co-host of “Robin Leach Talking Food,” as his second wife. Kristin Booth Glen, dean of City University Law School in Queens, presided over their wedding at Bolo.</p><p>Chefs Mario Batali and Tom Valenti were among the over ninety attendees, the majority of whom were male friends.</p><h2><span id=Before_their_marriage_they_dated_for_more_than_a_year>Before their marriage, they dated for more than a year.</span></h2><p>When Flay visited as a guest on her Food Network talk program in January 1994, that’s how he and his wife Connelly initially got together. It seems that when Kate was parenting her son Jonathan alone, she was also unmarried.</p><p>Connelly’s close friend Robin Leach stated,</p><p>There was an immediate appeal as well as warning signs of peril for both. He recognized he had met the lady he would give up bachelorhood for, and she was forewarned that he was a true bachelor.</p><p>They spent many hours at the Monkey Bar having supper just after the concert. She claimed that her encounter with Flay was the most amazing moment of her life. The two also were engaged shortly after they started dating.</p><p>However, they too didn’t survive long together, calling it quits in 1998. Their divorce was formalized not long afterward.</p><h2><span id=The_pair_also_had_a_daughter_who_worked_as_an_ABC7_journalist>The pair also had a daughter who worked as an ABC7 journalist.</span></h2><p>On April 16, 1996, Flay’s wife Connelly gave birth to their daughter, Sophie Flay. She received degrees from the University of Southern California in broadcast and digital journalism.</p><p>At the moment, Sophie works for ABC7 as a community journalist.

They were initially seen in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, the actress’s breakthrough performance in the entertainment business came from the popular television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><p>Following weeks of waiting, the pair embarked on their first blind date at Nobu in New York City. “I know it’s cliche, but I remember thinking, oh my gosh, this is the rest of my life,” she said to CNN.</p><p>The two had supper together there. After that, they started dating. Before Christmas 2003, he proposed with an ice rink located at Rockefeller Center. After being engaged, the pair wed.</p><p>Together, they made an appearance at the Diane von Furstenberg Fall/Winter Collection fashion show in New York City on February 9, 2003.

She started out as a waitress at Bar Americain in Midtown and eventually moved up to become his stant.</p><p>According to actress Maia Madison, March’s friend,</p><p>When she arrived at my place, she couldn’t stop crying. “I can’t believe the last ten years of my life have been a lie,” the woman said.</p><p>Madison went on to say,</p><p>Even when Stephanie wasn’t home, Elyse had visited her residence.</p><p>According to reports, Bobby and Elyse became close when Bobby assisted her following an automobile accident in 2010. According to sources, Flay was also absent when March required an emergency appendectomy in November 2013 due to an appendix rupture.</p><p>Moreover, Bobby failed to attend their tenth anniversary.</p><p>The couple filed for divorce in July of 2015 after parting ways in March of the same year. March’s adultery with Flay is alleged to be the cause of their acrimonious divorce, according to insiders.</p><p>Dan Benton and Stephanie were wed in 2017 and are now blissfully settled.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Flay8217s_Present_Status_in_Relationships_dated_Helene_York_a_girlfriend>What Is Flay’s Present Status in Relationships? dated Helene York, a girlfriend</span></h2><p>Following his breakup with March, Bobby Flay began dating Helene Yorke, the actress from Masters of Sex.

Regretfully, Flay’s romance ended this time too, just like it usually does.</p><p>After dating for a year, the two called it quits. He’s not dating right now either.
