During the session, Heather dismissed the idea that she was "trying" to look like her boyfriend, Tarek El Moussa's ex-wife, which she referred to as a "ridiculous" one.</p><p class=dh>"How would I be 'trying to look like someone?"

The real estate agent also managed to allow the partnership between Tarek and Christina to go on without hassle.</p><p class=dh>Back in September, PEOPLE <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-anstead-and-tarek-el-moussa-come-together-for-daughter-taylors-9th-birthday-party/>reported</a> that Tarek and his ex-wife came together to celebrate Taylor's ninth birthday.</p><p class=dh>The site stated that Tarek had taken to Instagram to share a photo that of Taylor lovingly squeezed between him and his girlfriend at the backyard pool party.</p><p class=dh>Although all seemed to be well in the Anstead-El Moussa home, observers found it odd that Tarek was yet to meet his ex's new son.</p><p class=dh>Pop Culture <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/11/04/tarek-el-moussa-still-hasnt-met-ex-wife-christina-anstead-new-son/>reported</a> where Tarek claimed during an interview with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tarek-el-moussas-looking-forward-to-knowing-christina-ansteads-son/>US Weekly</a> that he was scared of babies – that was why he hadn't met Christina's child yet.</p><p class="dh eh">to the 38-year-old:</p><p class=dh>"I haven't held him yet, because they're little and they scare me a little bit.

It's the brother to my kids.</p><p class=dh>The "Flip or Flop" star also disclosed that he loved the age that his biological children were, during the interview, at as it allowed them to share specific experiences. One such experience occurred when Tarek introduced his new girlfriend to his children according to a report <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/flip-or-flop-star-tarek-el-moussa-dating-after-divorce-t169060>detailed</a> by Today.</p><p class=dh>The TV personality divulged that he first spoke to his daughter as she was older than his son, Brayden. <a class="me a" href=#>Tarek</a> stated that he would drop bits and pieces of information about his girlfriend to avoid any difficulty when the kids finally met Heather in person.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, Tarek took the bold step and brought Heather over to family night.
