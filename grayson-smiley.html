And he might still be single now. In terms of gender preferences, he is forthright. Moreover, Grayson has not been involved in any dispute to date. He was in the news, though, because of his illness. Gray has survived brain cancer. At the time of his birth, he was perfectly healthy. However, he was diagnosed with acute brain cancer at a young age. And his illness worsened when he started kindergarten. As a result, his vision degraded as well.</p><p>In May 2006, the situation deteriorated worse. His mother took him to the hospital with the suspicion of stomach illness, but he was later diagnosed with a brain tumour in his head. He was later diagnosed with Diffuse Fibrillary Astrocytoma, a rare kind of brain tumour caused by astrocytoma cells. Because of the case’s complexities, the brain tumour could not be easily removed and had to be treated with chemotherapy. It is excruciatingly unpleasant for both Grayson and his mother, and the financial load is enormous. They’ve set up a GoFundMe page for financial management.</p><p>His parents, Michelle Arroyo and Slade Smiley are no longer together. Michelle did not marry or remain in a relationship with anyone after their divorce. Slade, on the other hand, ended his relationship with Jo De La Rosa in 2007. Furthermore, there are claims today that he has a close relationship with Gretchen Rossi. She was also a member of the cast of Keeping it Real.</p><h2><span id=Social_media>Social media</span></h2><p>Grayson Smiley prefers to keep to himself, away from social media and other distractions. His mother, Michelle Arroyo, and father, Slade Smiley, are both active on various social media platforms.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity kid</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>King Conde- All About Raul Conde & Erica Mena’s Son</a></h3>King Conde is the son of Erica Mena, a Vh1 Love Hip Hop New York actress, and model, and her ex-husband, rapper Raul Conde of the rap group Terror Squad.
