NXIVM was created by Keith Raniere. NXIVM was a cult that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, and other forms of organized crime.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurement>Body Measurement</span></h2><p><strong>Keith Kaniere is a tall man, standing at around 5 feet 7 inches in height.</strong> The offender has brown hair and blue eyes, and he wears a hoodie.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Bio>Early Life and Bio</span></h2><p>Keith Raniere was born on August 26, 1960, and he is currently 60 years old. Keith Raniere was born in the year 1960. His hometown is Brooklyn, New York, and he is born under the sign of the Virgo zodiac. When it comes to his parents, Keith’s father, James Raniere, and mother, Vera Oschypko, are to be mentioned. His father, who lived from May 9, 1932, to April 10, 2020, was an advertising executive in New York City who worked in the advertising industry. Keith’s mother, who lived from January 19, 1931, to December 13, 1978, and worked as a ballroom dancing instructor, had a similar life span.</p><p>His family moved from Brooklyn, New York, to Suffern, New York, when Keith was approximately 5 years old. Later, when he was roughly 8 years old, his parents divorced each other. Keith attended Suffern High School for his ninth-grade year, which was the culmination of his school experience. He did, however, go to Rockland Country Day School in Congers, New York, where he completed his education in June 1978.</p><p>Keith, now an adult, admitted that he first read Isaac Asimov’s Second Foundation, which dealt with the issue of mind control when he was 12 years old. He also attributes his work with NXIVM to the inspiration he received from this work. Later, in 1982, he received his bachelor’s degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a 2.26-grade point average (RPI).</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Keith Raniere is well-known for being a convicted felon and sex trafficker, as well as the creator of the NXIVM organization. However, it turned out to be a cult that was involved in sex trafficking, forced labor, and racketeering while pretending to be a multi-level marketing organization.</p><p>Keith’s company grew in popularity mostly as a result of its development seminars, which attracted the attention of various celebrities and socialites between 1998 and 2018. It has, however, been the subject of several allegations of institutional sexual abuse of female members.</p><p>Keith himself, as well as other members of his inner circle, were the perpetrators of sex abuse. It was as a result of this that they were apprehended in early 2018. As a result, Keith has been referred to as a cult leader in several media publications. After that, on June 19, 2019, Keith Raniere was found guilty of federal offenses. These offenses included child exploitation, conspiracy, and the conspiracy to instigate forced labor, just to name a few of them. It turned out that they were all connected to a secret organization within NXIVM. It was referred to as DOS or The Vow. Keith was sentenced to 120 years in jail on October 27, 2020, which was the next day.</p><h2><span id=A_career_in_multi-level_marketing><strong>A career in multi-level marketing</strong></span></h2><p>The multi-level marketing corporation Amway recruited Keith to be a part of their team throughout the 1980s. In addition, he worked as a computer programmer for the Division of Parole in the state of New York. “Consumers’ Buyline Inc. (CBI)” was the name of the multi-level marketing company that he created in 1990.</p><p>He was introduced to him at a CBI pitch meeting. Toni, together with her then-husband, went on to become a top salesman for the company in the following years. Toni and her kid relocated to Clifton Park to be closer to Raniere. Following the dissolution of her marriage, Keith and Toni began dating and remained together for the next eight years, until their separation in 1999. The CBI was shut down in 1993 as a result of probes by 20 states.</p><p>He went on to build the “National Health Network” the following year. It was a multi-level vitamin distributor that went out of business in 1999. Then, in the mid-1990s, Toni and Keith opened a health-products business on the corner of Main and Broadway. Keith and Nancy Salzman are the co-founders of Executive Success Programs. Nancy is a registered nurse who has had specialized training in hypnotism and neurolinguistic programming. They changed the name of “Executive Success Programs” to “NXIVM” and marketed it. In 2002, the business partners were successful in attracting members of the powerful Bronfman family to their company. The Bronfmans were the heirs to the multibillion-dollar Seagram wealth, which they inherited. The Bronfman sisters, Sara and Clare, as well as their father, Edgar Bronfman Sr., were all involved.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Keith Raniere estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

Toni filed filings in federal court in 2011, stating that Keith had raped her on multiple occasions over a while. Keith’s next relationship was with Barbara Bouchey, with whom he was in a relationship from 2000 to 2009. Barbara was one of the people who disagreed with him. Keith was also in a relationship with Kristin Keeffe from 2007 to 2014, and they were married in 2014. Keith and Kristin had a daughter named Gaelyn in 2007, which they named after Keith. They were also the parents of another son, Kemar.</p><h2><span id=Keith_Raniere_was_Arrested>Keith Raniere was Arrested</span></h2><p>On the 5th of June, 2017, Frank Parlato reported that a secret sorority known as DOS was active. According to him, using a hot cauterizing pen, the women known as “slaves” were marked with Raniere’s initials to distinguish them from other women. The New York Times then published a story on it on October 18, 2017, in which they also said that the slaves were compelled to share nude images or other potentially harmful information about themselves when they joined. Following the publication of these pieces, Keith went to Mexico. Keith was accompanied by a few members of his inner group.</p><p>On the 18th of January, 2018, the authorities obtained a search warrant for his Gmail account. The following day, on February 14, 2018, an FBI agent filed a criminal complaint and arrest warrant in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the defendant. Later, in March 2018, investigators from the Mexican Federal Police apprehended the offender while he was staying in a luxury property outside of Puerto Vallarta. According to Lauren Salzman, when the cops arrived, they interfered with a scheduled group sex session. In the wake of Keith’s appearance in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, the Mexican authorities surrendered custody of Keith to New York authorities.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>In the same vein, the offender does not appear to have any personal or official profiles on any social networking websites. It’s possible that his accounts were stopped or deleted following Keith’s conviction and punishment of 120 years behind bars.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Andor Lilienthal</a></h3>Andor Lilienthal estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
