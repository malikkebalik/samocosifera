Our client is working with the prosecutor’s office and anticipates resolving this matter quickly by entering a plea agreement with the court on Monday, December 18th.Ruby Franke is a devoted mother and is also a woman committed to constant improvement. Initially, Ms. Franke believed that Jodi Hildebrant had the insight to offer a path to continual improvement. Ms. Hildebrant took advantage of this quest and twisted it into something heinous. Over an extended period, Ms. Hildebrant systematically isolated Ruby Franke from her extended family, older children, and her husband, Kevin Franke. This prolonged isolation resulted in Ms. Franke being subjected to a distorted sense of morality, shaped by Ms. Hildebrandt’s influence.During Ruby Franke’s incarceration in Washington County jail over the past few months, she has actively engaged in an introspection that has allowed her to reset her moral compass and understand the full weight of her actions. Ms. Franke is committed to taking responsibility for the part she played in the events leading up to her incarceration. Demonstrating a sincere dedication to personal growth and rehabilitation, she has actively begun the process by reaching out to members of her family. Through heartfelt apologies, she seeks to mend relationships and contribute positively to the healing journey of her family.Ruby is aware that Kevin Franke has filed for divorce. While she is devastated by this news, she acknowledges and understands his anger and reasoning. Despite the pain, she respects his decisions and remains hopeful that, with time, she can contribute to rebuilding trust and fostering understanding within their family. Ruby has offered her full cooperation to help the children reunite with their father.Winward Law recognizes the profound love that Ms. Franke holds for her children, and we are genuinely saddened that she found herself on this challenging path under the influence of Ms. Hildebrant. It is our firm belief that Ms. Franke is a devoted mother who, unfortunately, was led astray. She is sincere in her commitment to securing the best possible future for her family, and we remain hopeful that, with the right support and understanding, she can navigate a path of healing and growth.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmp5mknryvedaoqaWcX6W5pq2MnZyapF2axbGxwq2cnWWkpLGixYyaqmaZpKm8s7rEsqpmmpyWuqZ5yaibomWYnrmlscGrmKecpGKzsL6Mq6ybsV2bv6K6yp6qZpyZqMGwvtOem2arlaPApnnOn2Smp6KWuarA2A%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html&text=Ruby%20Franke%27s%20case%20could%20wrap%20with%20plea%20deal%20as%20her%20defense%20sets%20sites%20on%20Jodi%20Hildebrandt&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html&title=Ruby%20Franke%27s%20case%20could%20wrap%20with%20plea%20deal%20as%20her%20defense%20sets%20sites%20on%20Jodi%20Hildebrandt" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html&title=Ruby%20Franke%27s%20case%20could%20wrap%20with%20plea%20deal%20as%20her%20defense%20sets%20sites%20on%20Jodi%20Hildebrandt" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html&title=Ruby%20Franke%27s%20case%20could%20wrap%20with%20plea%20deal%20as%20her%20defense%20sets%20sites%20on%20Jodi%20Hildebrandt" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fruby-franke-s-case-could-wrap-with-plea-deal-as-her-defense-sets-sites-on-jodi-hildebrandt.html&description=Ruby%20Franke%27s%20case%20could%20wrap%20with%20plea%20deal%20as%20her%20defense%20sets%20sites%20on%20Jodi%20Hildebrandt" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shopper-says-apple-staff-hurried-him-others-to-storage-room-during-boise-mall-shooting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shopper says Apple staff hurried him, others to storage room during Boise mall shooting">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./piotr-iwanicki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Piotr Iwanicki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
