She took to Instagram to tell her fans about her wedding with Paco on <strong>September 23, 2012</strong>, with a post from their wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the affiliation of Zazueta with his father's butcher shop, he does not have the luxury to keep traveling. However, his wife Melissa as an actress requires traveling a lot. This has caused the husband and wife to stay apart from each other.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Mexican musician supports his wife's goal.
