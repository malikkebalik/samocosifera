The star-studded wedding was attended by Weston’s close family, including, mom, Christina Fulton, great-uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, and great-aunt Talia Shire. However, one special guest missing from the festivities was Weston’s famous father, who was filming abroad. In her court filings, Hila explained that she made every effort to work around the Renfield actor's hectic schedule yet he callously insulted her by skipping the wedding.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2 class=split>'Nic did not even bother to show up'</h2><p>The mother-of-two also alleged that Weston and his father, who is reportedly worth $25 million, didn't even contribute to the extravagant feast or the Moroccan-themed after-party, which had a cigar bar, a hookah lounge, a picture booth, and tarot readers. “Your honor, I funded our entire wedding with the funds I saved up and loans I personally took on. Weston and Nic did not help financially for the wedding,” Hila said in her declaration according to</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8d60708b-274f-4b82-8130-ebdaf794295d.1175150395><p>“Nic did not even bother to show up even after I changed the wedding date twice, moving all the vendors and arrangements twice to accommodate his schedule just so Weston wouldn’t have to feel bad that his father was not at his wedding,” she continued. Hila further asserted that she took the brunt of her father-in-law's absence as Weston was led down the aisle by her mother, Christina Fulton. “And then, I ended up getting blamed by Nic for not checking the date with him when the entire wedding date setting revolved around Nic’s schedule multiple times,” she fumed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/63c42cfd-5fe8-4b4d-aa59-fe3938b5ffe9.1133734489><h2 class=split>'Nic has bankrolled against me'</h2><p>Hila acknowledges in court filings that the Cage wedding debacle is "out of the scope" of the financial assistance request she made on January 30, 2023, but she only wanted to show to the Court how the Cage family treated her before, during, and after her early 2021 separation from Weston. She called the courtroom confrontation a "litigious campaign of harassment either Nic and/or Christina have bankrolled against me." In her declaration, Hila even blasted the ‘Lord of War’ actor for breaking his vow to take care of his grandchildren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7f96627d-88dd-4431-a7d6-2d97745e7321.1392277333><p>“The funds he is spending on litigation to fight against providing support for his family are either from his father, Nicolas Cage, or his mother, Christina Fulton,” she wrote, adding, “Nic is allowing his son and the mother of his child to commit despicable deeds against his daughter-in-law and his granddaughters, despite my plea for him to talk some sense into Weston and his promise to ‘take care of us if Wes doesn’t.” Hila has currently been demanding $4,634 in monthly child and spousal support from Weston.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoppmYvK2t0maamp%2BVqHqmxIydmK6fmKmys3nIp2SlmadiwK2tzKxkoaGdYrOwvoysoqKooJ67qHnSqKWsZWJlfnl51p6bnaGenA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html&text=%27I%20ended%20up%20getting%20blamed%27%3a%20Nicolas%20Cage%27s%20ex-daughter-in-law%20Hila%20Coppola%20slams%20him%20for%20skipping%20s&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html&title=%27I%20ended%20up%20getting%20blamed%27%3a%20Nicolas%20Cage%27s%20ex-daughter-in-law%20Hila%20Coppola%20slams%20him%20for%20skipping%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html&title=%27I%20ended%20up%20getting%20blamed%27%3a%20Nicolas%20Cage%27s%20ex-daughter-in-law%20Hila%20Coppola%20slams%20him%20for%20skipping%20s" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html&title=%27I%20ended%20up%20getting%20blamed%27%3a%20Nicolas%20Cage%27s%20ex-daughter-in-law%20Hila%20Coppola%20slams%20him%20for%20skipping%20s" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-ended-up-getting-blamed-nicolas-cage-s-ex-daughter-in-law-hila-coppola-slams-him-for-skipping-s.html&description=%27I%20ended%20up%20getting%20blamed%27%3a%20Nicolas%20Cage%27s%20ex-daughter-in-law%20Hila%20Coppola%20slams%20him%20for%20skipping%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-buckner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Buckner">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./petra-ecclestone-and-sam-palmer-enjoy-a-family-day-out-at-disneyland-with-their-four-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Petra Ecclestone and Sam Palmer enjoy a family day out at Disneyland with their four children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
