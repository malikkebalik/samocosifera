Until 16 December 2011, she was not recorded as the shortest woman in the world’s history.

Considering her dwarfism, many people no doubt became interested in who it was that caught her fancy so much she was willing to walk down the aisle with him.</p><p>To add more spice, a single photo that showed Jyoti with an Indian man was posted on many websites. Many people believed that was her husband and immediately started sending Jyoti congratulatory messages on social media. This, however, was just a hoax that she wasn’t happy about.</p><p>In 2017, Jyoti Amge filed an FIR (First Information Report) with the Cyber Crime Wing of the Nagpur Police against an individual in the US who had spread rumors on the internet that he got married to her.

She focuses on her career as an international actress for now.</p><h3><strong><span>What Condition Does Jyoti Amge Have?</span></strong></h3><p>Jyoti Amge is considered a goddess in India’s homeland, thanks to achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism she was born with that saw her make history as the world’s smallest woman alive. Jyoti measures 62.8 cm (2 ft 0.6 in) in height which is shorter than the average two-year-old child.</p><p>Achondroplasia is a bone growth disorder that affects the changing of cartilage to bone. It prevents growth and changes, particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs, preventing anyone with the condition from growing taller. It limits the range of motion at the elbows, gives the sufferer a large head and small fingers but normal intelligence.</p><p>Just like any other regular child, Jyoti Amge attended school. However, her size brought its requirements, specifically a desk and a chair that was made just for her. She has also had other things custom-made for her, like her clothes and jewelry.</p><p>Even her plates and utensils are specially made as normal-sized silverware is often too big for her to use. She has often complained that her biggest issue is being carried around because of her miniature size and having people treat her like a child, even though she is, in fact, a full-grown woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryan-Murphy-Jyoti-Amge.jpg><h2><strong>Notable Facts About Jyoti Amge</strong></h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Jyoti Amge was born on December 16, 1993, in Nagpur, Maharashtra in India.
