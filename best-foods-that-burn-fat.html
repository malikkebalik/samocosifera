However, it is quite unfortunate that despite all the smart weight loss moves you make, the scale has refused to move accordingly. This is the case with a lot of people and is probably one of the top reasons many people give up on their <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>weight loss journey</a> after trying so hard.</p><p>The truth is, your smart weight loss moves may not be so smart after all; at least not as smart as those sneaky foods that can lead to bloating, water retention, and general <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>weight gain</a>. Such foods deposit unwanted fat in places you least expect them. Like in your belly, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>your face</a>, your back causing you to look out of place and shape.</p><h2>“OK, So, What Exactly Should I Eat To Outsmart Those Sneaky Foods?”</h2><p>First of all, let’s be clear on the fact that you don’t have to depend wholly on a restrictive diet just because you want to get rid of excess fats in your body. Restrictive diets say; “eat less of all your meals to lose weight”. But our list says; “<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eat healthy to lose weight</a>”.</p><p>The fact is, it’s not necessarily about eating less, but about eating the right foods at the right time without feeling like you’re starving yourself. As a matter of fact, eating more of certain foods will boost your metabolism and increase your ability to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>burn calories</a>. Here are the 10 best fat burning foods that will jump-start your metabolism.</p><h2>1. Salmon</h2><p></p><p>There are a lot of dietary benefits of salmon, but the most outstanding of them all is that it is <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>rich in omega-3 fatty acid</a>, which your body cannot produce on its own. Omega-3 is very effective in fighting inflammations and burning fats in your body, especially around your liver. This could be linked to its low glycemic index which prevents insulin spikes and fat storage around your body’s mid-section.</p><p>Salmon, which is a great source of lean protein, helps in the development of muscle mass when you’re trying to lose weight. It is also good for the brain, heart, guts, and joints.</p><h2>2. Berries</h2><p></p><p>There are tens of known reasons why berries are among the healthiest foods on earth. One of such benefits is that eating a lot of them will increase your rate of metabolism and help you shed some fats.</p><p>Berries are packed with a lot of dietary fiber and oxidants, but they contain less sugar compared to other fruits. This means you get to enjoy healthy digestion and no inflammation in your mid-section. They are very satisfying as well.</p><h2>3. Avocados</h2><p></p><p>You need to actually make a full square meal from avocados if you want to burn some fats. But, “doesn’t avocado contain fats?” Yes, it does, but they are good fats. And eating a lot of those good fats (also known as mono-saturated fats) can help you maintain good health, including a healthy weight.</p><p>Avocados also contain fibers, vitamins, minerals, phytosterols, and antioxidants. All of these lead to improved diet quality and nutritional intake.</p><h2>4. Quinoa</h2><p></p><p>This grain is one of the most popular super-foods there is, which is not surprising because it’s a great source of many dietary benefits. Adding quinoa to your diet will change your weight loss game for the good, starting with your belly seeing as it is high in fiber.</p><p>Another very important point about quinoa is that it is 20-hydroxyecdysone. This means eating quinoa helps you absorb less fat from your diet. This is part of the reason it is a great alternative to acid-forming grains such as wheat and barley.</p><h2>5. Grapefruits</h2><p></p><p>Grapefruit is blessed with some anti-inflammatory nature that causes weight loss. It contains compounds like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>folic acid</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>vitamin C</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>iron</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>sodium</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>zinc</a>, thiamin, protein, and lots more. It is <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>rich in fiber</a> too.</p><p>It has a lot of health benefits including respiratory health, detoxification, promotes good sight, aids with hair growth and glowy skin. Also, these nutrients have a special effect on your body insulin in a way that keeps your blood sugar in check and also help to burn calories.</p><h2>6. Sardines</h2><p></p><p>This is another food known to be rich in the omega-3 fatty acid in addition to many other healthy nutrients. It is particularly low in mercury, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>rich in vitamin B</a> and choline. Sardines also have a high-quality protein that is not inflammatory.</p><p>Eating a lot of sardines will help you burn some fats because of its omega-3 fatty acid content. It also has anti-cancer properties, reduces the risk of macular degeneration, promotes a healthy immune system, strong bones, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>healthy skin</a>.</p><h2>7. Green Tea</h2><p></p><p>Replacing most of your drinks (excluding water) with green tea may be a little too extreme, but you’re going to be happy with yourself after a couple of weeks. Taking a lot of green tea will set your metabolism on fire (in a good way), burning as much fat as possible in the process.</p><p>Green tea contains caffeine and catechin, both of which have antioxidant properties and can <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>speed up metabolism</a>.</p><h2>8. Oats</h2><p></p><p>Most people in the western world, if not all, have had oats for breakfast at one time or the other. Nothing less than 75% of the American population eats oatmeal for breakfast. That is how popular oatmeal is. It is very simple food that’s easy to make and is nutritious as well.</p><p>Oats contain a special nutrient known as Beta-glucan. This component contributes to the well being of the good bacteria in the body, thereby ensuring healthy guts. Oats also contain soluble fiber which makes you tend to feel full more quickly and for longer.</p><h2>9. Kale</h2><p></p><p>The health benefits of kale are no secret. For one, it has more vitamin C than an orange! It is rich in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>vitamin A</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>calcium</a>, iron, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>magnesium</a>, copper, and so on. Its weight loss property can be linked to its high fiber content which slows down the release of glucose in the body.</p><p>Eating kale also promotes eye health, promotes healthy skin, controls the cholesterol level in the body, helps in the management of diabetes, stomach ulcer, cancer, and anemia.</p><h2>10. Hemp Seed</h2><p></p><p>Hemp seed is another superfood with an impressive nutritional profile providing a host of health benefits. Hemp seeds are <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>very rich in protein</a>, fiber, minerals, vitamins, iron, zinc, magnesium, etc.</p><p>Some of the health benefits of hemp seeds include protecting the brain, the heart, reducing inflammation, and improving skin conditions. It has also been profiled as one of the best foods to eat if you want to burn some fat and control your weight.</p><p>Nothing beats losing fats in a reliable natural way. Experts believe that there is no safe magic pill that can burn the fats in your body overnight as marketers lead us to believe. Losing body fats is all about eating right, not just for a week or two, but for the rest of your life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpucrKxdm7ywsNJmq6GZpGKvtr7NZp2arF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html&text=Best%20Foods%20That%20Burn%20Fat&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html&title=Best%20Foods%20That%20Burn%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html&title=Best%20Foods%20That%20Burn%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html&title=Best%20Foods%20That%20Burn%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-foods-that-burn-fat.html&description=Best%20Foods%20That%20Burn%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-paul-contract-its-impact-on-his-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Paul Contract &amp;amp; Its Impact On His Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./are-frank-ocean-and-omar-apollo-dating-twitter-viral-picture-tassco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Frank Ocean And Omar Apollo Dating?
