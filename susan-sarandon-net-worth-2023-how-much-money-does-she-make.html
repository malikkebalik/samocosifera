Sarandon will probably rent out the house to make money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Favorite Quotes By Susan Sarandon</h2><p>“When you start to develop your powers of empathy and imagination, the whole world opens up to you.”</p><p>“New York is very user-friendly if you don’t want to be in a car all the time. It can also provide you with surprises because it’s so compressed – if you walk around, you just find things.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I look forward to being older when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the point.”&nbsp;</p><p>“In the theater, you’re so much more in charge as an actor. For better or for worse, you know what the audience is seeing. But you can be acting your socks off on film, and then you see the movie, and the camera is on the other actor, or they’ve cut out the lines you thought were significant, or they’ve adjusted the plot. So much of it is out of your control.”</p><p>“I just want my kids to love who they are, have happy lives, and find something they want to do and make peace with that. Your job as a parent is to give your kids not only the instincts and talents to survive, but help them enjoy their lives.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6jCtK3NZqqaqpGjsbC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tIytn6KrXa6yor6Oa25samlk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html&text=Susan%20Sarandon%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20She%20Make%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html&title=Susan%20Sarandon%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20She%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html&title=Susan%20Sarandon%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20She%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html&title=Susan%20Sarandon%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20She%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsusan-sarandon-net-worth-2023-how-much-money-does-she-make.html&description=Susan%20Sarandon%20Net%20Worth%202023%3a%20How%20Much%20Money%20Does%20She%20Make%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./trevor-knight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trevor Knight">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pik11-tv-reporter-jill-nicolini-is-rumored-to-be-dating-a-peter-khachaturian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PIK11 TV Reporter, Jill Nicolini is Rumored to be Dating a Peter Khachaturian">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
