Let's take a look inside the life of Christina Ricci's daughter.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAIN FACTS ABOUT CLEOPATRA</strong></p><p class=dh>American actress Christina Ricci announced that she was expecting in August 2021. The 42-year-old decided to share the great news by posting an image of an ultrasound on her Instagram. She captioned the photo by <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSZ5g-KF352/>saying</a>, "Life keeps getting better."</p><p class=dh>The star wasn't the only one excited about the news of her pregnancy. Her then-boyfriend, Mark Hampton, also shared the information with his fans on Instagram by posting a series of sonograms and also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-pregnant-expecting-second-baby/>captioned</a> them with the words "Life Keeps getting better!!!"</p><p class=dh>"The Addams Family" star welcomed her baby girl Cleopatra Ricci Hampton on December 8, 2021. Her daughter's zodiac sign is Sagittarius, and Cleopatra's father couldn't wait to share the lovely news on Instagram.</p><p class=dh>Cleo's father, Mark Hampton, took to Instagram and posted a photo of his newborn. He shared an image of his baby girl sleeping on a hospital bed wearing a stripped beanie wrapped in a blanket. He captioned the picture by <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-and-husband-mark-hampton-welcome-first-baby/>saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My heart has exploded. @riccigrams and baby Cleo are doing fantastic, we're all resting after such an eventful morning.. welcome to the world baby Cleopatra Ricci Hampton."</p><p class=dh>The ecstatic dad also shared the news on his Instagram Stories, giving fans a peek at the mother and daughter's first moments together.</p><p class=dh>Cleo's parents are both linked to Hollywood. Her mom Christina Ricci is a famous actress mostly known for playing unusual characters. Cleo's father, Mark Hampton, is a celebrity hairstylist and makeup artist.</p><p class=dh>The "Monster" actress appeared on The Ellen Show in early 2022 and spoke about her baby.

She said when she and her husband were preparing to welcome their daughter, they talked about the name Cleo.</p><p class=dh>However, Cleo's father somehow thought the name was short, and the full name was Cleopatra, so he used it for his public announcement on social media. So when her mother found out, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN5u_dJqDuY">thought</a>: "And so I guess so I was like, 'Oh I guess, I guess her name is Cleopatra.'"</p><p class=dh>The baby names website Nameberry reports that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/christina-ricci-gives-birth-daughter-husband-mark-hampton-t242590>the name Cleopatra</a> is a name for girls and is of Greek origin. When it comes to the meaning of the name, the site says it means 'glory of the father.'</p><p class=dh>According to Nameberry, Cleopatra is "a royal name in ancient Egypt that's never quite made it to the modern world." The nickname Cleo is said to be more popular than the name Cleopatra.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>CLEOPATRA IS A FREQUENT GUEST ON HER PARENTS' SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></p><p class=dh>Cleopatra Ricci Hampton's parents can't help but show off their beautiful daughter.

Some fans quickly pointed out Cleo has her mom's eyes.</p><p class=dh>In another <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbh3ZBkl-bj/>post</a> just a month later, Cleo can be seen wearing an orange top, dark blue pants, and pink socks while lying on pillows with a doll on top of her.</p><p class=dh>Cleo seems to spend a lot of her time with her beloved mom, as even when her famous mother does her hair and makeup, the little one is also there.</p><p class=dh>Cleo's mom shared a black and white image on her Instagram of her getting her makeup done while holding Cleo on her lap. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CeEchHLFItU/>wrote</a> in the caption:</p><p class=dh>"What getting in hair and make up looks like these days."</p><p class=dh>Little Cleo looks a lot like the actress and has the star's big beautiful eyes.

Speaking to ET Canada, Christina <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-ricci-slept-through-emmy-announcement-because-daughter-was-teething-all-night/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My baby was teething really badly all last night. So I didn't actually get to sleep really until 5 in the morning."</p><p class=dh>The "Wednesday" actress said she needed time to recover and rest after caring for Cleo the whole night, so she didn't attend the event.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>CLEO HAS A BIG BROTHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Cleopatra Ricci Hampton is not Christina's only child.

She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN5u_dJqDuY">expressed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He's great. He loves being a big brother so much. He kisses her all the time...he's being very good."</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Christina Ricci</a> also said even though Freddie "does not like the lack of sleep and chaos that is going on in the house," he has still been amazing and loves his little sister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbWlja3qkuMSop5qsopZ6s7XCnKBmoJGivbW7zaxkp5mdmnq4rdJmp6Kbm5qxb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html&text=Cleopatra%20Ricci%20Hamptons%20Name%20Was%20Picked%20by%20Her%20Father%20-%20Story%20behind%20It%20and%20Other%20Facts%20about%20Ch&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html&title=Cleopatra%20Ricci%20Hamptons%20Name%20Was%20Picked%20by%20Her%20Father%20-%20Story%20behind%20It%20and%20Other%20Facts%20about%20Ch" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html&title=Cleopatra%20Ricci%20Hamptons%20Name%20Was%20Picked%20by%20Her%20Father%20-%20Story%20behind%20It%20and%20Other%20Facts%20about%20Ch" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html&title=Cleopatra%20Ricci%20Hamptons%20Name%20Was%20Picked%20by%20Her%20Father%20-%20Story%20behind%20It%20and%20Other%20Facts%20about%20Ch" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcleopatra-ricci-hampton-s-name-was-picked-by-her-father-story-behind-it-and-other-facts-about-ch.html&description=Cleopatra%20Ricci%20Hamptons%20Name%20Was%20Picked%20by%20Her%20Father%20-%20Story%20behind%20It%20and%20Other%20Facts%20about%20Ch" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jake-bequette.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Bequette">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-hip-hop-week-in-review-chuck-d-gets-political-kid-cudi-on-wzrd-papoose-on-illuminati.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Hip Hop Week In Review: Chuck D Gets Political, Kid CuDi On &amp;quot;WZRD,&amp;quot; Papoose On Illuminati">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
