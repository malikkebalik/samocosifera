According to Craig, Thompson has been making partial or no payments since November 2022, resulting in a debt of $224,000. This comes after Thompson reached an agreement in 2019 to pay Craig a monthly stipend of $40,000.

According to Craig, Thompson has either been making partial payments or completely missing payments since November 2022. The outstanding amount owed by Thompson is reported to be nearly a quarter of a million dollars, amounting to $224,000.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Partial_or_Missing_Payments_Since_November_2022></span>Partial or Missing Payments Since November 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In her court filing, Jordan Craig provided a detailed list of payments made by Thompson over a 10-month period. The records indicate that Thompson sent her $20,000 in November, paid in full in December, and failed to make any payment in January. From February to July, he made six payments of $14,500 each, and in August, he sent her $29,000. These irregular payment patterns have led Craig to seek legal intervention to ensure consistent child support payments.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Agreement_Reached_in_April_2019></span>Agreement Reached in April 2019<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Back in April 2019, Tristan Thompson and Jordan Craig had reached an agreement regarding child support. At that time, Thompson, who was earning $17.7 million annually as a player for the Cleveland Cavaliers, agreed to provide a monthly stipend of $40,000. However, since then, Thompson’s financial circumstances have changed, with the birth of two more children from different relationships. This has raised concerns for Craig, who is now seeking the court’s assistance in enforcing the child support agreement.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tristan_Thompsons_Child_Support_Payments></span>Tristan Thompson’s Child Support Payments<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The issue of child support payments involving NBA star Tristan Thompson has come to light recently. There are claims that Thompson is facing difficulties in meeting his financial obligations towards his child, Prince, whom he shares with his ex-partner, Jordan Craig. The matter has escalated as Craig alleges that Thompson owes a significant amount of money in child support.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Payments_Made_Over_10-Month_Period></span>Payments Made Over 10-Month Period<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A closer look at the payment history reveals a pattern of irregularities. According to Jordan Craig’s filing, Thompson made partial payments or missed payments entirely since November 2022. The records show that Thompson sent $20,000 in November, paid in full in December, and failed to make any payment in January. From February to July, he made six payments of $14,500 each, and in August, he sent $29,000. These inconsistencies have raised concerns about Thompson’s commitment to fulfilling his financial responsibilities.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Request_to_Withhold_Cavaliers_Income></span>Request to Withhold Cavaliers Income<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In light of the ongoing issues with child support payments, Jordan Craig is seeking legal intervention. She has requested the court to withhold Thompson’s income from the Cleveland Cavaliers, his current team, in the amount of $80,000 per month. This measure aims to ensure that the outstanding child support payments are satisfied. Craig believes that this request is reasonable, considering Thompson’s reported annual salary of $2.7 million with the Cavaliers. By seeking this action, Craig hopes to secure a stable and consistent financial support system for their child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Accusations_and_Reactions></span>Accusations and Reactions<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tristan-Thompson-Allegedly-Owes-Ex-Jordan-Craig-224K-in-Child-Support.jpg alt="Accusations and Reactions" width=1200 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordans_Sister_Accuses_Tristan_of_Neglecting_Prince></span>Jordan’s Sister Accuses Tristan of Neglecting Prince<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In a recent turn of events, Jordan Craig’s sister, Kai Craig, has publicly accused Tristan Thompson of neglecting their nephew, Prince. Kai took to Instagram to express her concerns, stating that it has been difficult for her to remain silent for over seven years. She emphasized that it is painful to witness Tristan’s apparent lack of involvement in Prince’s life, especially when he finds time to do kind gestures for others. Kai’s statement sheds light on the strained relationship between Tristan and his son, raising questions about his commitment to fatherhood.</p><h3>Kim Kardashian’s Positive Remarks on Tristan’s Parenting<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Contrary to the accusations made by Jordan Craig’s family, Kim Kardashian, the sister of Tristan’s ex-partner Khloé Kardashian, has spoken positively about Tristan’s parenting abilities. In an episode of Hulu’s “The Kardashians,” Kim praised Tristan for stepping up and supporting Khloé when she faced challenges with her own children. Kim’s remarks highlighted Tristan’s willingness to be present and involved in the lives of his other children, despite the ongoing controversies surrounding his relationships. This contrasting perspective adds complexity to the public perception of Tristan’s parenting and raises questions about the truth behind the allegations.</p><p>Jordan Craig, the ex-girlfriend of NBA star Tristan Thompson, claims that he owes her nearly $224,000 in child support payments for their 6-year-old son.
