Tragically, she was brutally murdered by a fellow soldier named Aaron David Robinson. Vanessa Guillén had been unaccounted for over a span of more than two months prior to the discovery of certain dismembered remains concealed near the Leon River on June 30.</p><p>Following the revelation of this grim finding, Aaron David Robinson chose to flee from Fort Hood. As law enforcement authorities endeavored to apprehend him in the vicinity of Killeen, Texas, Robinson ultimately took his own life through a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Perpetrators_Identity></span><strong>The Perpetrator’s Identity</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cecily Aguilar, a local resident identified by authorities as Robinson’s girlfriend, was arrested and accused of aiding him in dismembering and burying the body of Guillén. On July 2, 2020, Aguilar was officially charged with a federal offense of conspiring to tamper with evidence. Subsequently, on July 13, 2021, she was indicted on eleven charges by a federal grand jury. On November 29, 2022, Aguilar pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact, as well as three counts of providing false statements.

Furthermore, it revealed that the leadership within her unit failed to take appropriate action after she came forward with her complaint.</p><p>Since her passing, the family has been advocating for reforms in the military’s approach to handling cases of sexual assault and harassment.</p><p>Natalie Khawam, the Guillen family attorney, expressed her sentiments in a statement: “Today, justice has been served for my clients—Vanessa Guillen’s family, her friends, and our nation! Cecily Aguilar has been sentenced to 30 years by Judge Albright. This marks the long-awaited closure in this case. I extend my gratitude to the US Attorney’s office, the Texas Rangers, and all the law enforcement personnel who wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to prosecuting this case.
