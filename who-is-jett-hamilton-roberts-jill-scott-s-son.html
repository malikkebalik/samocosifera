However, there are a few aspects of his life that most people have no clear knowledge of, and this article sheds light on who Jett Hamilton is and what his life is like as Jill Scott’s son.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jett Hamilton Roberts’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Jett Hamilton Roberts</li><li><strong>Gender: </strong>Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>April 20, 2009</li><li><strong>Jett Hamilton Roberts’ Age: </strong>14 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign: </strong>Taurus</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Jett Hamilton Roberts’ Parents: </strong>Lil&nbsp;John Roberts (father) and Jill Scott (mother)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Jill Scott’s And John Roberts’s son</li></ul><h2><strong>Jett Hamilton Roberts is 14 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton Roberts was born to his parents, Jill Scott and Lil John Roberts, on April 20, 2009, in Los Angeles, California, USA. The celebrity kid is of mixed ethnicity (African-American) and is an American by nationality, while his Zodiac sign is Taurus.</p><p>In his early days, Jett was raised mostly in his birth city of Los Angeles, California, and is said to be the only child born to his father and mother. According to reports available, his birth was nothing less than a miracle, especially to his mother, as she was once married for seven years but was unable to conceive due to a medical condition she was diagnosed with in her 20s.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/241667852_433032661510037_5421796973348557253_n-1.jpg alt="Jett Hamilton Roberts" width=696 height=696 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At some point, she was advised by the doctors to have a hysterectomy in other to avoid developing cervical cancer later in life, which might have been caused by her condition at the time. The singer decided to follow her faith and not go for the hysterectomy, hoping that someday she would be able to get pregnant and have her own child.</p><p>Her long-awaited prayers were answered with the birth of Jett Hamilton. Jett’s mother had embarked on a trip to Botswana for the shooting of an HBO film, and the role she was to play required her to put on some weight, but the actress realized that she added weight more than expected, and this prompted her to get several tests done including pregnancy test which came out positive.</p><p>The pregnancy was not an easy one as she faced challenges, especially in the first trimester, but as fate would have it, she scaled through the whole trimester and gave birth to Jett successfully after enduring a 36-hour labor period.</p><p>There is no information on his academic records as the young star’s life has been kept secret and away from the media. But we know that Jett Hamilton is in middle school and is getting his education from a prestigious school.</p><h2><strong>He Does Not Have A Clear Career Path Yet</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton Robert is yet to take on a career path as he is still very young and under the care of his parents. As a child born to parents who have a booming career in the entertainment industry, many are expecting the celebrity child to follow in his parent’s footsteps and take on a career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Well, we can only wait and see what the future holds when Jett is ready to take on a career path. But whichever career path he chooses, we are sure his parents will be of great support to him.</p><h2><strong>Jett Hamilton’s Father is a Famous Drummer</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton Roberts’ father, Lil John Roberts, born on March 25, 1972, is a well-known drummer by profession. John Roberts was born into a Christian home and was a preacher’s kid. To date, Lil John Roberts is regarded as one of the most accomplished drummers of his time.</p><p>The professional drummer has been opportune to collaborate with well-recognized musical artists, which include artists like Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, and also Jett’s mother, Jill Scott.</p><h2><strong>His Mother is a Famous Singer and Composer</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton Roberts’ mother, Jill Scott, is a phenomenal singer and composer who has been acknowledged worldwide for her contributions to the American music industry.

Two years later, she won a second time in the category of Best Traditional R&B Performance for her work on God Bless The Child alongside George Benson and Al Jarreau. Her most recent award was in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category in 2008 for Daydreaming alongside Lupe Fiasco.</p><h2><strong>Jett’s Parents Were Once Engaged But Never Got Married</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton Roberts’ parents, Lil John Roberts and Jill Scott, were engaged to be married as at the time of his birth. There is no information on how Jett’s parents met, but just like every other love story, the ex-lovers had met and became friends for some time before they began dating. Being that they are both in the entertainment industry, many had speculated that the duo had met at a music event.</p><p>After dating for some time, the duo decided to commit to each other by taking their relationship to the next level. The ex-lovers had announced their engagement at a Carnegie Hall concert on June 20, 2008, in front of a large audience which was sealed with a kiss while the audience applauded them.</p><p>However, to the amazement of many, the lovebirds never made it to the altar and announced their separation a few months after the birth of their love child, Jett Hamilton.&nbsp; This announcement was made on June 23, 2009, with Jill Scott admitting that the emotional turmoil she felt in the weeks following the birth of her child contributed to the reasons for their separation.</p><p>Jill Scott also revealed that regardless of their separation, they had agreed on an arrangement to co-parent peacefully and remain friends.</p><h2><strong>Jett Hamilton Roberts Shares a Strong Bond With His Mother</strong></h2><p>Jett Hamilton shares a strong bond with his mother, and this is evident on his mother, Jill Scott’s Instagram account, where she regularly posts photos of them together.&nbsp; Jill has been the one shouldering most of the burden of taking care of her son, although she has disclosed that she has never considered herself a single mom as she has gotten assistance from her friends and family in raising Jett Hamilton.</p><p>On the other hand, the extent of the relationship between Jett Hamilton and his father cannot be ascertained as there has not been much talk about him and his father being together. However, certain reports have it that Lil John occasionally makes out time to see his son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdn7K1wIyhmKahnKm8r3nRqJmeqqSoequ1y6VkrJufqcG0edKopWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html&text=Who%20Is%20Jett%20Hamilton%20Roberts%2c%20Jill%20Scotts%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jett%20Hamilton%20Roberts%2c%20Jill%20Scotts%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jett%20Hamilton%20Roberts%2c%20Jill%20Scotts%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jett%20Hamilton%20Roberts%2c%20Jill%20Scotts%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jett-hamilton-roberts-jill-scott-s-son.html&description=Who%20Is%20Jett%20Hamilton%20Roberts%2c%20Jill%20Scotts%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./get-affordable-tickets-for-alabama-football-games-in-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Get affordable tickets for Alabama football games in 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wendy-thomas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wendy Thomas">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
