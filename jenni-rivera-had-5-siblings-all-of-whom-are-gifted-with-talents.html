They have developed a reputable record in the film and music industry, with a few Grammy nominations and awards spread around the family.</p><p class=dh>The great Jenni Rivera was born on July 2, 1969, and had her life cut short by an untimely incident on December 9, 2012. She was married three times before and was getting a divorce with her husband, Esteban Loaiza, when she suddenly died, leaving the divorce inconclusive.</p><p class=dh>Her family is decorated with heavy hitters in Latin music, and one of her brothers is a Grammy award winner. Jennie has been nominated four times at the Latin Grammy awards and boasts a cabinet of Billboard Music Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/aa1da8eec799bfa614de03e6e38f776a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Esteban Loaiza and his late wife, Jenni Rivera, at the 27th Annual Imagen Awards hosted at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on August 10, 2012. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Jenni was a famous performer who expressed her talents through various mediums. Her résumé boasts experience in <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1648381/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">varying fields</a> such as acting, singing and songwriting, TV production, philanthropy, and entrepreneurship. She is widely remembered for her contributions to Latin music.</p><p class=dh>Jenni is the eldest daughter of Rosa Rivera and actor and composer Pedro Rivera. Thanks to Pedro, the Rivera family carried the flag of his creativity and established themselves in music and film. Jenni had five siblings; let's look closely at who they are and what they do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ec836f974978cee9901b071d28f50471.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jenni Rivera performing at the 11th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, hosted at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 11, 2010. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Pedro Rivera Jr.</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In continuance of his father's legacy and name, Pedro Rivera Jr. is a musician that has contributed to the music industry; however, his approach is slightly different as he has taken the religious route. Pedro Jr. was born on April 20, 1964, and he gravitated to worship music and pastorship while growing up.</p><p class=dh>Although it is written in Spanish, Pedro Jr.'s <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.youtube.com/@pedroriverajr8336/about>YouTube account's description</a> translates that he makes Christian songs of praise for families and everyone seeking the calling to Jesus Christ. His life is anchored by family and faith in God.</p><p class=dh>He conducts his densely populated church sermons on Facebook Live, where he goes live at 12:30 p.m. on Sundays and 7:30 p.m. on Thursdays. Pedro Jr. also runs live streams of his addresses on the YouTube page that houses his music on Sundays at 1:40 p.m. Most of his work can be accessed on his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/pedroriverajr/>Instagram account</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Gustavo Rivera</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Jenni's second oldest sibling, Gustavo Lawrence Rivera, was born on March 1, 1966, in Senora, Mexico. He has also inherited the musical genes of his father, Pedro, and is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/452381-meet-jenni-riveras-brothers-lupillo-juan-pedro-gustavo/>well known</a> for being Jenni's brother.</p><p class=dh>Gustavo is a performing artist who shares his memorable moments on stage on his social media. His Instagram page also reveals that he is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/aliasgustavorivera/?hl=en">family-orientated</a> and spends a lot of time with his wife, Patty, his daughter Karin, and his son Gustavo.</p><p class=dh>He often promotes his merchandise line "Gustavo Rivera" and shows his love for a good meal on social media. The singer loves a good serving of buffalo wings with a side of blue cheese sauce. He posted a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CndhuUkjudt/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">video of himself</a> devouring a plate of wings with the caption, "so so soooo good BUFALLO WINGS <i class=ch>[sic]</i>."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Lupillo Rivera</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Lupillo Rivera is also a multi-talented individual. He was born on January 30, 1972, possibly in La Barca, Jalisco, Mexico, or Long Beach, California. His birth name is Guadalupe Rivera, but those who know him better call him El Toro del Corrido. Lupillo is an actor and composer like his father.</p><p class=dh>His <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1747997/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">most recognizable work</a> is on "Las Nieves de Enero," released in 1995, "The 3 Wise Men," released in 2003, and "One Long Night," which was released in 2007. On April 29, 2006, Lupillo married his wife, Mayeli Rivera, with whom he shares one child.</p><p class=dh>Lupillo is also a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.grammy.com/artists/lupillo-rivera/12241>Grammy award-winning</a> artist. He was awarded the Best Banda Album award for his album "Tu Esclavo Y Amo" at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. He also boasts a few nominations for Best Banda Album in the 50th and 51st editions of the Grammys.</p><p class=dh>Lupillo's childhood dream was to become a restauranteur, but as he grew up, his father assigned him to talent-scouting duties, which birthed his desire to be a singer. He has been largely successful as a musician, boasting a catalog of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/452381-meet-jenni-riveras-brothers-lupillo-juan-pedro-gustavo/>hit Latin records</a>, including "En Acustico," "24 Horas," and "Mi Homenaje a Pedro Infante."</p><p class=dh>Lupillo is one of Jenni's more famous siblings, with a 2.4 million following on Instagram at the time of writing. His music is popular in the Latin American community and Los Angeles, like the Grammy nominee <a class="me a" href=#>Maluma</a>, who once admitted to having a crush on fellow West Coast resident and model Kendall Jenner.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Juan Rivera</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>On February 22, 1987, Jenni's parents welcomed their fifth child, Juan Rivera, in Long Beach, California. Juan is a layered creative who has dabbled in acting, singing, and the technical side of movie sets. Born into a home of coveted screen actors and musicians, Juan was inspired to make music at 16.</p><p class=dh>His music career kicked off with his first recording, "El Atizador," in 1996, and he went on to excel in music and film. He has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2063337/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">credited for production</a> on "Last Time Forever," gaffer duties on "Unraveled," and camera work on "Kidnapped." Juan has <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/452381-meet-jenni-riveras-brothers-lupillo-juan-pedro-gustavo/>acting credits</a> in "La Dinastia de Los Perez" and "Jefe de Nadie."</p><p class=dh>As of late, Juan has been very <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/juanriveramusic/>active on social media</a>, sharing lots of reel content about his ongoing experience on "La Casa de Los Famosos 3," which is the celebrity edition of "Gran Hermano USA" on Telemundo.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rosie Rivera</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In keeping with her family's legacy, Rosie Rivera pursued a career in Hollywood. Unlike her siblings and father, Rosie has settled for mainly behind-the-scene roles as a producer. In 2014, Rosie was cast in a starring role in the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://peopleenespanol.com/article/rosie-rivera-asegura-que-no-es-rica-famosa-latina-como-la-describe-el-reality-estrellatv/>reality TV show</a> "Rica, Famosa, Latina," which aired on Estrella TV. She is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8415233/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">also known for</a> "Jenni Rivera: Aparentemente Bien."</p><p class=dh>In 2014, she spoke about not considering herself to be the three things mentioned in the reality show's title, which translates to Rich, Famous, Latina. Although it is evident that she comes from a Latin bloodline, she is a humble individual who clarifies that the fame and fortune in her life belong to her family members.</p><p class=dh>Over the years, she has evolved into an author, entrepreneur, and influencer, with talk show hosting experience and motivational content on her Instagram account. Her latest book, "God Is Your Defender," is available at Harper Collins Christian Publishing.</p><p class=dh>Rosie is a mother of three: <a class="me a" href=#>Kassandra Rivera</a>, born in 2003; Elias Melek Flores, born in 2015; and Samantha Chay Flores, born in 2013. Sadly, Jenni was involved in a fatal plane crash near Monterrey, Mexico, but for Pedro Sr., the extension of branches on his <a class="me a" href=#>family tree</a> could be a form of consolation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaWxibXqrsc2noGaqmauys62MoZidZWViwKquy6KloKtdlrmtedahpqZlkaeyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html&text=Jenni%20Rivera%20Had%205%20Siblings%2c%20All%20of%20Whom%20Are%20Gifted%20with%20Talents&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html&title=Jenni%20Rivera%20Had%205%20Siblings%2c%20All%20of%20Whom%20Are%20Gifted%20with%20Talents" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html&title=Jenni%20Rivera%20Had%205%20Siblings%2c%20All%20of%20Whom%20Are%20Gifted%20with%20Talents" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html&title=Jenni%20Rivera%20Had%205%20Siblings%2c%20All%20of%20Whom%20Are%20Gifted%20with%20Talents" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenni-rivera-had-5-siblings-all-of-whom-are-gifted-with-talents.html&description=Jenni%20Rivera%20Had%205%20Siblings%2c%20All%20of%20Whom%20Are%20Gifted%20with%20Talents" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./johnny-depp-called-vanessa-paradis-a-c-t-in-elton-john-email.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Johnny Depp called Vanessa Paradis a c--t in Elton John email">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeanie-buss-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeanie Buss - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
