In their defense, the strategy had worked in the past seasons. But instead of looking for new stars, the network plucked two of their best stars from Naked and Afraid, EJ Snyder and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Zausch</a>. Both stars were well received and had made a name for themselves. On paper, things worked out perfectly. But in reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. The pair failed to find any chemistry and the series fell apart. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki bio of EJ Snyder. Also, we will delve into his personal life aspects like his marriage and children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody readability=17><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Errol James Snyder Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Skullcrusher</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>December 3, 1965</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>58 years old</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place of birth</td><td>Englewood, New Jersey, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White-Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 feet 3 inches (191 cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>194 lbs (88 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Black (natural)</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Marital status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Amy Snyder</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Children</td><td>Tyler (son) and Kassidy (daughter)</td></tr><tr><td>Military service</td><td>25 years (1984-2009)</td></tr><tr><td>Military rank</td><td>Sergeant Major</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Military awards</td><td>Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal (2), Order of St.&nbsp;Maurice (Centurion), and 40 others</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Survival skills</td><td>Leadership, building shelter, tracking, navigation, self-defense, trapping, primitive weapons, fire making, water procurement, edible plants</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Television shows</td><td>Lost (2004), Patton 360°(2009), Naked and Afraid (2013-2021), 72 Hours(2013), Naked and Afraid XL(2015-2021), Dual Survival(2016-2017), Survival T.V.

On the other hand, Errol’s brother Jeff passed away in 1986, Just before Errol’s 22nd birthday. EJ attended Ranger School and received his first survival training. He later attended the Army Survival school and started working as a survival expert.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life in the Army</h2><p>EJ decided to join the army when he was just 19 years of age. This was back in 1984. EJ served for 25 years in the army and during which, EJ served the infantry and was also a part of the airborne units.

He then starred in two reality TV series, Naked and Afraid and Dual Survival. EJ paired up with Kellie Nightlinger for the second episode of the very first season. The pair had to survive in Tanzania’s Serengeti Plain. The episode aired on the 30th of June, 2013, and was titled, Terror in Tanzania.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EJ-SNyder-along-with-Kellie-Nightlinger.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dual Survival</h2><p>EJ was greeted with rave reviews from fans and critics alike. Everyone was impressed with EJ’s quick thinking and skills to put the thinking into action. So when the ratings of Dual Survival started going down, EJ was called into action. He had to pair up with another Naked and Afraid survivor, Jeff Zausch. Even though great things were expected from the pair, there was no real chemistry and the series closed shop in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Naked and Afraid, Naked & Afraid XL:</h2><p>EJ had a short-lived career in Dual Survival, he appeared on season 9&nbsp; which turned out to be the last.

The first controversy is related to Snyder’s childhood bullying.&nbsp;According to his biography on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>, Snyder experienced bullying when he was growing up in North Jersey.&nbsp;This motivated him to become interested in strength training and self-defense. However, some critics have accused him of being a bully himself on the shows he participated in. For example, on Naked and Afraid XL, he clashed with several other survivalists over leadership, resources, and strategies. He also had a heated argument with Matt Wright. Some viewers felt that Snyder was too aggressive, arrogant, and domineering towards his teammates.</p><p>The second controversy is related to Snyder’s scrotum injury.&nbsp;On the sixth season of Naked and Afraid XL, Snyder suffered a gruesome injury when he fell from a tree branch into the swamp.&nbsp;The fall resulted in severe lacerations to his scrotum, which required eight stitches by the show’s medical team.&nbsp;Snyder was given the option to leave the challenge and seek medical treatment at a hospital, or stay in the game and risk infection and the loss of his genitals.&nbsp;He chose to stay and continue the 60-day challenge.&nbsp;However, some critics have questioned his decision and called it reckless, irresponsible, and foolish.&nbsp;They argued that he put his health and life at risk for the sake of a television show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>A wise man knows how to make the most of the situation, and EJ seems to be in sync with the statement.
