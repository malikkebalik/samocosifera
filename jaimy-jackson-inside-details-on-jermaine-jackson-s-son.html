His father is most recognized as a family member of the world-renowned dancer Michael Jackson, rather than as a musician.</strong></p><p>Despite being the star kid, Jaimy has kept a low-key lifestyle. Jaimy has always been the center of attention as a member of the well-known Jackson family. Millions of fans of Michael Jackson and his siblings want to know about their children, and Jaimy is one of Jackson’s children.</p><p>So, today, we have exclusive information about one of Jackson’s brothers, Jermaine Jackson’s son, Jaimy Jackson. Take a close look at the article below for more information.</p><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Jaimy Jackson’s Age and Childhood</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Jaimy is descended from a musical family;</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Jaimy Jackson has two brothers and four half-siblings.</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> A Brief History Of Jaimy’s Parents’ Marriage And Divorce</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> What is Jaimy Jackson’s occupation?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Is Jaimy Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, married?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Is Jaimy Jackson Rich Like His Father, Who Is A Millionaire?</a></li></ul><h2><span id=Jaimy_Jackson8217s_Age_and_Childhood>Jaimy Jackson’s Age and Childhood</span></h2><p>On March 17, 1987, Jaimy Jackson was born to parents as ‘Jaimy Jermaine Jackson’ in the United States of America. In 2023, he will celebrate his 36th birthday.</p><p>Of course, as a child, he did not have a good family atmosphere due to his parents’ formal separation when Jaimy was only a year old. As a result, he was raised alone by his mother, Hazel Gordy, along with his two older siblings.</p><p>Furthermore, in terms of ethnicity, the star child is African-American and of American nationality.</p><h2><span id=Jaimy_is_descended_from_a_musical_family>Jaimy is descended from a musical family;</span></h2><p>Joseph Walter Jackson, Jaimy Jackson’s paternal grandpa, was an American talent manager who temporarily played guitar with the Falcons, a rhythm and blues band. Similarly, his paternal grandmother, Katherine Scruse, who is now in her early 90s, was an amateur musician as well. She has studied the clarinet and the piano.</p><p>Similarly, Jackson’s father is also a musician. Four of his father’s siblings, Jackie, Tito, Marlon, and Michael, are also musicians. In truth, these five brothers were members of a band called The Jackson 5.</p><p>Jaimy’s grandfather, Berry Gordy Jr., is also a record executive, record producer, and songwriter on his mother’s side. Berry is also the creator of Motown, a Universal Music Group record label. Thelma Louise Coleman Gordy is his maternal grandma.</p><h2><span id=Jaimy_Jackson_has_two_brothers_and_four_half-siblings>Jaimy Jackson has two brothers and four half-siblings.</span></h2><p>Jaimy was the youngest child of his parents. Jermaine La Jaune “Jay” Jackson Jr., his older brother, was born on January 27, 1977. Soltan Soul Jackson, his 46-year-old brother, is now a father. Asa Soltan Rahmati, his long-term lover, is the mother of his kid.</p><p>Similarly, he has a 9-year-old sister named Autumn Joi Jackson. Autumn, 44, was born on June 16, 1978, and is now married to producer Narinder Singh.</p><p>Jaimy is also a half-brother to his four other half-siblings. He has two brothers, Jeremy Maldonado Jackson, 36, and Jourdynn Michael Jackson, 34, as a result of his father’s relationship with Margaret Maldonado. Similarly, Jaime has two older brothers from his father’s marriage to Alejandra Genevieve Oaziaza: Jaafar Jermiah Jackson, 27, and Jermajesty Jermaine Jackson, 22.</p><h2><span id=A_Brief_History_Of_Jaimy8217s_Parents8217_Marriage_And_Divorce>A Brief History Of Jaimy’s Parents’ Marriage And Divorce</span></h2><p>Jermaine and Hazel Jackson married on December 15, 1973, at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. Both spouses were 19 at the time of their marriage.</p><p>However, after more than a decade of marriage, their married life began to deteriorate due to Jermaine’s extra-marital affair with Margaret Maldonado, with whom he even welcomed an illegitimate son. Gordy later filed for divorce from her husband, and they divorced in 1988.</p><p>After their divorce, Jaimy’s father continued his connection with Margaret for five years before deciding to end it. In 1995, he married Alejandra Genevieve Oaziaza, and the couple was married until May 2003. A year later, in January 2004, he married his third wife, Halima Rashid. In 2016, the couple divorced as well.</p><p>His mother, on the other hand, decided to live a private life after her divorce from Jermaine and now works as a licensed real estate agent.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Jaimy_Jackson8217s_occupation>What is Jaimy Jackson’s occupation?</span></h2><p>Despite coming from a prominent family, Jaimy tries to keep his personal life secret. To yet, neither Jackson nor his renowned father have spoken openly about his working life in the public.</p><p>So it’s unclear what the 35-year-old star kid does for a career. However, because he comes from a musical family, it is reasonable to assume that he, like his father and grandparents, has some musical ties.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jaimy_Jackson_Michael_Jackson8217s_nephew_married>Is Jaimy Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, married?</span></h2><p>Since the celebrity kid has led a low-key life, his personal life, like his work, has piqued the public’s interest. Because of his extraordinary private life, media access to his inner life is exceedingly tough, and Jaimy’s absence from social media handles adds to the mystery surrounding his relationship status.</p><p>Though he is more reserved about his marriage or affair, it is evident that a man in his mid-30s is in a relationship. In this aspect, he may be dating or married, but he does not want to be public about it.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jaimy_Jackson_Rich_Like_His_Father_Who_Is_A_Millionaire>Is Jaimy Jackson Rich Like His Father, Who Is A Millionaire?</span></h2><p>Jermaine, Jaimy’s musician father, has a net worth of $1.5 million as of 2023. He undoubtedly earned this large sum via his music career.</p><p>Moving on to Jaimy, his occupation is still unknown, as is his net worth. However, as a celebrity son, he must live a lavish lifestyle.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Son</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>All About Emily Chen!
