You may wonder if you can still use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device, even if the battery is dead or the phone is turned off. The answer depends on several factors, such as the model of your iPhone, the iOS version, and the settings you have enabled. In this article, we will explain how Find My iPhone works, what are the requirements and limitations, and how to use it to find your lost iPhone in different scenarios.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is Find My iPhone and How Does It Work?</h3><p>Find My iPhone is a feature that allows you to remotely locate, lock, erase, or play a sound on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch, or AirPods, using another Apple device or a web browser. You can also use it to share your location with your friends or family members, or to find them on a map. Find My iPhone is part of the Find My app, which combines the functions of the previous Find My iPhone and Find My Friends apps.</p><p>To use Find My iPhone, you need to have an Apple ID, and sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on all your devices. You also need to enable Find My iPhone on each device you want to locate. To do this, go to Settings > [your name] > Find My > Find My iPhone, and turn on the toggle. You can also enable other options, such as:</p><ul><li>Find My network: This allows your device to be located by other Apple devices nearby, even if it’s offline or turned off. This works for iPhone 11 and later models running iOS 15 or later.</li><li>Send Last Location: This sends the last known location of your device to Apple when the battery is critically low, so you can see where it was before it died.</li><li>Offline Finding: This allows your device to be located by other Apple devices nearby, even if it’s not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular. This works for iPhone 6s and later models running iOS 13 or later.</li></ul><p>Once you have enabled Find My iPhone on your device, you can use another device or a web browser to access the Find My app or the iCloud website, and sign in with the same Apple ID. You can then see a map with the location of your device, and perform various actions, such as:</p><ul><li>Play Sound: This makes your device play a loud sound, even if it’s on silent mode, so you can hear it if it’s nearby.</li><li>Directions: This gives you turn-by-turn directions to your device’s location, using Apple Maps.</li><li>Mark as Lost: This locks your device with a passcode, and displays a custom message with a phone number where you can be reached. It also disables Apple Pay, and tracks the location of your device.</li><li>Erase This Device: This deletes all the data and settings from your device, and prevents anyone from activating it. It also disables Find My iPhone, so you won’t be able to locate it anymore.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Does Find My iPhone Work When the Phone is Dead?</h3><p>The answer is yes, but only under certain conditions. If your iPhone is dead, you won’t be able to see its current location, but you may be able to see its last known location, if you have enabled the Send Last Location option. This option will send the location of your device to Apple when the battery is critically low, and you can view it on the Find My app or the iCloud website. However, this location may not be accurate or updated, depending on when and where your device died.</p><p>If your iPhone is turned off, you may still be able to locate it, if you have enabled the Find My network option. This option will allow your device to be located by other Apple devices nearby, even if it’s offline or turned off. This works for iPhone 11 and later models running iOS 15 or later. You can view the location of your device on the Find My app or the iCloud website, and perform the same actions as if it was online. However, this option may not work if there are no other Apple devices nearby, or if your device has been turned off for a long time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How to Find Your Lost iPhone When It’s Dead or Turned Off</h3><p>If you have lost your iPhone, and you suspect that it’s dead or turned off, you can try the following steps to find it:</p><ul><li>Use another Apple device or a web browser to access the Find My app or the iCloud website, and sign in with the same Apple ID as your lost device.</li><li>Tap or click on Devices, and select your lost device from the list. You will see a map with the location of your device, and its status, such as online, offline, or no location available.</li><li>If your device is online, you can tap or click on Play Sound, Directions, Mark as Lost, or Erase This Device, depending on what you want to do.</li><li>If your device is offline, you can tap or click on Notify When Found, to receive notifications and location updates when your device is turned on or connected to a network. You can also tap or click on Mark as Lost or Erase This Device, to activate them the next time your device is online.</li><li>If your device has no location available, you can tap or click on Notify When Found, to receive notifications and location updates when your device is turned on or connected to a network. You can also check the last known location of your device, if you have enabled the Send Last Location option. To do this, tap or click on the information icon next to your device’s name, and scroll down to see the date and time of the last location update.</li></ul><p>Does Find My iPhone Work When the Phone is Dead: The Ultimate Guide is an article that explains how to use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device, even if the battery is dead or the phone is turned off.
