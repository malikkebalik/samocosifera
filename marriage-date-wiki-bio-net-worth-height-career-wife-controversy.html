Kyle became one of the most popular and controversial characters on the show, known for his partying, drinking and relationship drama with his girlfriend Amanda Batula. He appeared in all six seasons of Summer House from 2017 to 2023, and also starred in its spin-off series Winter House in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;In addition to these shows, he also appeared in the TV series The Traitors in 2023, where he played himself as a contestant in a reality show that tests the loyalty and trust of the participants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>He has a net worth of over $1 million from his businesses, such as Loverboy, Fenix, Birddogs, and appearing in various TV series like Summer House and Winter House.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Relationships</h2><p>Kyle Cooke is currently married to Amanda Batula and the pair have been together since 2015. Although they made things official in September of 2018, they have had an on and off relationship for years. In 2017, they broke up to focus on their careers but reconciled in 2018. They planned to get married on September 25, 2020 and invited their friends and family, including some of their “Summer House” and “Winter House” costars. Kyle said that it was going to be a New York City wedding.</p><p>However, they had to postpone their date three times because of the health and safety protocols due to COVID-19 pandemic. They finally tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Amanda’s home in New Jersey in September, 2021. The wedding was attended by several of their “Summer House” and “Winter House” costars, as well as some friends from “Southern Charm”. Kyle and Amanda looked radiant and happy as they exchanged vows and celebrated with their loved ones. Since then, Kyle and Amanda have been married for almost two years now and are living in New York City with their dogs named Dixie and Ryder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy</h2><p>Kyle Cooke is no stranger to controversy, both on and off the screen. He has faced several challenges and scandals in his personal and professional life. Some of the most notable ones are:</p><p><strong>Cheating on Amanda Batula</strong>: Kyle admitted to cheating on his girlfriend Amanda in 2018, a year before he proposed to her. He confessed that he kissed another woman while drunk at a wedding. The revelation caused a rift in their relationship and made them question their trust and commitment. They eventually worked through their issues and got married in 2021.</p><p><strong>Loverboy lawsuit</strong>: Kyle’s sparkling hard tea brand Loverboy was involved in a lawsuit with Night Shift Distributing, a wholesaler and craft brewer, in 2021. Night Shift accused Loverboy of terminating a contract without cause or paying fair value. Kyle filed a counterclaim alleging breach of contract by Night Shift. The case was resolved in September 2021, with both parties agreeing to dismiss it with prejudice and pay their own legal fees.</p><p><strong>Party animal reputation</strong>: Kyle is known for being the life of the party on “Summer House” and “Winter House”, but his excessive drinking and partying have also caused him trouble. He has gotten into fights with his friends, embarrassed himself in front of strangers, and jeopardized his health and career. He has also struggled to balance his work and fun, often neglecting his responsibilities or missing deadlines.</p><p><strong>Feuds with costars</strong>: Kyle has clashed with several of his costars on “Summer House” and “Winter House”. He has accused them of being disrespectful, dishonest, immature, or manipulative. He has also defended his wife Amanda from their criticism or insults. He has tried to mend some of his relationships, but others remain strained or broken.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Physical trait</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 feet 1 inch (185 cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td>Tattoos</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Piercings</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Style</td><td>Casual, trendy, colorful</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiisqSVYrCwu8qeZLChm556o7XOZqSaqqKerqixjJ2YrZ1dm7aiusKeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html&text=Marriage%20date%2c%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%2c%20Controversy.&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html&title=Marriage%20date%2c%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%2c%20Controversy." target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html&title=Marriage%20date%2c%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%2c%20Controversy." target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html&title=Marriage%20date%2c%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%2c%20Controversy." target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarriage-date-wiki-bio-net-worth-height-career-wife-controversy.html&description=Marriage%20date%2c%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%2c%20Wife%2c%20Controversy." target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bizzy-bone-bio-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bizzy Bone  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./little-italy-is-on-the-brink-of-extinction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Little Italy is on the brink of extinction">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
