Simone?</strong></h2><p>Braelyn Simone was born on April 5, 1990, in Dallas, Texas, the United States of America to her African-American parents, who we have limited information on as of now. She is currently 33 years old this year. Her parents however got divorced when she was still young and she was raised by her Pastor father and stepmom.</p><p>As she grew up, B. Simone had a strained relationship with her mom; no doubt due to the divorce and her relationship with her stepmom was described as having “a negative influence in her life.” Her closest adult family member, therefore, was her grandmother, who she basically grew up with and still lives with to this day.</p><h3><strong>What is B. Simone’s Real Name?</strong></h3><p>Her given name is Braelyn Simone Greenfield, with Simone being her middle name. However, she is more popularly known by her alias B. Simone, which is still basically a shortened version of her full name.</p><h2><strong>She Started Early in Life To Pursue Things She is Passionate About</strong></h2><p>Recalling her days as a teenager growing up in Dallas, Simone described herself as the class clown who made students and teachers laugh with her antics. She was also very artsy; loving to do stuff with her hands and very creative as well. This was what informed her decision to leave the traditional path of going to college, even when she had the chance to, and go instead to cosmetology school.</p><p>B Simone started braiding hair at 15 years, so with her talent and love for all things hair, she started working out of her grandmother’s saloon, making some cool cash for herself braiding and tending after her clients’ hair. She also loved music and had once joined a girl group in order to keep that dream alive and this paid off. In the years that followed, she began to actively pursue a music career.</p><h3><strong>B. Simone Moved to Atlanta to Start a New Phase of Her Life at 24 Years Old</strong></h3><p>Simone moved to Atlanta, Georgia at the urging of a friend in 2014, when she was 24 years old, in order to pursue her music career as an independent artist. It was a tough move for a young woman who had hitherto enjoyed living rent-free with her grandma. In Atlanta, she worked retail, as a waitress in a strip club, waiting tables and doing other odd jobs.</p><p>Of course, she continued with her music, dropping various singles and albums from time to time without relenting. Apparently, though her work was demanding, she found a way to balance her means of livelihood and keep pursuing her career interests. And interestingly, in 2012, she even auditioned for BET’s The Search contest but unfortunately didn’t make the cut.</p><h3><strong>Her Success Story Started From Her Rant Videos&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Working round the clock was definitely stressful for B. Simone and like most people she chose to rant about her pent-up frustrations on Instagram and just like that she instantly became famous. Many people could relate to the things she ranted about and with this, it was easy for her to attract followers online.</p><p>Before her fame on Instagram, however, she was already active and relatively famous on another popular social media platform at the time called MySpace. She also had a decent following on Pinterest. But Instagram seemed to have offered her kind of content the audience and resources she needed to grow further.</p><p>Also, her followers seem to enjoy her ranting videos more than her music videos and her comical rant clips soon evolved into storytelling then skits, and finally into full-blown comedy. Leveraging on her viral clips online that boosted her popularity, B. Simone was able to launch a successful career; hosting the last days of 106 & Park and beginning her television series as a recurring cast member of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nick Cannon</a>‘s MTV’s popular comedy show Nick Cannon Presents Wild ‘N Out in 2017.</p><p>Before then, she had already starred in a lead role in #DigitalLivesMatter (2016). One of her greatest career achievements was undoubtedly when she was selected for the lineup of the Lit AF Comedy Tour, hosted by Martin Lawrence.</p><h3><strong>Braelyn Simone Greenfield’s Comedy Tour “You’re My Boooyfriend” Shot Her Career to Greater Heights at 28 Years Old</strong></h3><p>In 2018, at 28 years old, B. Simone headlined her own sold-out comedy tour, You’re My Boooyfriend, across the country. The next year at 29, she produced and starred in her TV series which also went by the same name<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> You’re My Boooyfriend</a> on Zeus Network.</p><p>At the same time, she starred in the reality TV series Girls Cruise and also appeared on the game show Hip Hop Squares. She has also appeared on episodes of the TV series Ridiculousness and Dish Nation. She has also appeared on an episode of Wildstyle Battle | Wild ‘N Out where she took on <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>DaBaby</a>.</p><h2><strong>B. Simon’s Social Media Stats Shows She Isn’t Relenting in Her Career</strong></h2><p>It isn’t surprising that her social media accounts are exploding with activity, after all that was what propelled her off to stardom; her Instagram account has a whopping 5.8 million followers, while her Facebook account has 1.7 million followers.</p><p>Her YouTube channel is slowly closing in on a million subscribers as she currently has 798k subscribers, with more than 54 million views. She isn’t left out on Twitter with 244k followers and her Know For Sure Podcasts are available on YouTube, Spotify, Google, iHeart, and also Apple Podcasts.</p><p>Aside from her main accounts on some of these social media platforms listed above, the comedian cum businesswoman has also leveraged her fame to set up other accounts still in her name. Two of such accounts are her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>B. Simone Beauty</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>B. Simone FIT</a> Instagram accounts.</p><p>In the former with over 317k followers is a “Beauty, cosmetic & personal care” Instagram channel where she promotes what she calls Vegan and cruelty-free makeup and also sells some lush cosmetics products. In the latter with a decent 203k followers, she shares her fitness journey with her followers and encourages them to work towards the body they want. She also advertises her sports-related merchandise on the platform.</p><h3><strong>She Has Endorsed Many Brands by Leveraging Her Social Media Fame</strong></h3><p>With this massive following on social media, you can bet her social currency is quite high; from endorsement deals with adverts on her pages as well as live concerts for her teeming fans. B. Simone has bagged endorsement deals from brands that include SAVAGE X FENTY BY RIHANNA, Fashion Nova, WhatWaist, La Fête Rosé, UNICORN UNIVERSE, Yummy Hair Extensions, and many others.

Simone’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Simone’s net worth is pegged at $2 million or more; with the majority of her income coming through her influencing and designer career, beauty brand, and endorsement deals. B. Simone made<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> her first million dollars</a> at the age of 30, in 2020, after hustling for close to 15 years.

With these ventures and their remarkable success stories since inception, B. has shown that she is not only a talented entertainer/comedian but also an astute businesswoman.</p><h4><strong>Book Authorship</strong></h4><p>She is also the author of Baby Girl: Manifest Your Life, published in 2020. Simone had hoped the book would help other women manifest their desires just as she had, but the book, although resourceful, was plagued with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> accusations of plagiarism</a>. B. Simone later came out to say that she was directly involved in the publishing of the book and thus wasn’t aware of the breach of trust. The publishing company was subsequently sued.</p><h4><strong>Music and Acting Career Earnings</strong></h4><p>Her acting career is also another viable source of income, having starred in more than 9 movies, including #DigitalLivesMatter (2016), Rent Due (2020), and Scheme Queens (2022).</p><p>And let’s also not forget her music career, with songs like “The Box Freestyle”, “Wet Jewels”, “Million Dollar Freestyle”, “Mixed Feelings”, and “Blueberry Rain”, among others in her name, still generating income on various music platforms.</p><h2><strong>B.

Like most weight loss journeys it hasn’t been easy, but our girl is quite persistent and has been making progress now and then.</p><p>This has not stopped her from receiving hate from some quarters for her ‘not so perfect physique’, but true to her nature, the ever-confident comedy queen couldn’t care less about haters. She is a proponent of body positivity, choosing to forego surgery and stick instead to exercise and a good diet; a journey she takes fans along on her Instagram page B.
