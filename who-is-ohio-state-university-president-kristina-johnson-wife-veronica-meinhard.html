Kristina Johnson is the 16th president of the esteemed Ohio State University.</p><p>To qualify for the latter, Kristina served as the State University of New York's 13th Chancellor from September 2017 to June 2020.</p><p>She left that post after Ohio State University's Board of Trustees named her as the next candidate to be the university's next president as the preceding president, Michael V. Drake, had retired.</p><p>She was chosen for this role not only because of her role as the 13th Chancellor of the State University of New York but also because of her role in developing 3-D imaging, color management systems, and optoelectronic processing systems.</p><p>Sadly, it seems that her time with Ohio State University is coming to an end.</p><h2 id=who-is-kristina-johnson-w>Who Is Kristina Johnson Wife Veronica Meinhard?</h2><p>Ohio State President Kristina Johnson is married to Veronica Meinhard who is a founder of Juniper Philanthropy Partners LLC.</p><p>Despite her recent forays into philanthropy, Kristina has had experience in many different avenues and fields.</p><p>She started her career in 1994 while working for her alma mater, the University of Florida's Alumni Association, as their Director of Gator Club Relations and Special Interest Groups.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/0f191a85-3734-42df-8397-d3b01cc9986f.webp></p><p>She worked there until December 2000, and then two years after she left the job, on November 2002, she started working for the University of Florida Foundation as their Director of Regional Development & Assistant Campaign Director.</p><p>She worked at this job for over seven years until she left on January 2010 to start working as the University of Florida College of Medicine's Senior Director of Principal Gifts.</p><p>She worked in the position until January 2013. After working almost twenty years at the University of Florida-associated institutions, she left to start forking for Gator Boosters, inc as their Director of Major Gifts in February 2013.&nbsp;After working there for two years, she left on August 2015 to go back into higher education.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/9b2c52eb-b823-4552-bae7-e731f5c9533a.webp></p><p>But, instead of the University of Florida, it was the University of Maryland where she first worked as the Assistant Vice President of Principal Gifts from August 2015 to September 2019 and then as their Interim Assistant Vice President for University Relations from July 2017 to September 2019.</p><p>As for Meinhard and Johnson's relationship, they got together in around 2013 through some of their best friends and couples who had been together for over fifteen years.</p><p>These friends thought that since Johnson and Meinhard had a background in higher education and athletics (Meinhard was a four-time All-American swimmer at the University of Florida, and Johnson played varsity field hockey at Stanford), they should meet.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Donates $1 Million Dollars To Ohio State University</h2><p>Earlier this year in May, Kristina Johnson and her wife Veronica Meinhard donated over a million dollars to Ohio State University.</p><p>The donation would be used, amongst other things, to endow two scholarships focused on student-athletes and first-generation students.</p><p>One of the major reasons behind this decision is in part due to Johnson's ongoing battle to make sure students can earn their degrees debt-free.</p><p>As such, her and her spouse's donation is a shining example of them leading by example so that others can follow suit.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/9b3a6110-19c8-4fb2-bb63-2e54a6c187bf.webp></p><p>The two scholarships will be named after Johnson and Meinhard.</p><p>The first scholarship, Kristina Johnson Endowed Scholarship Fund will be for undergraduate student-athletes, especially in the Ohio State women's field hockey and lacrosse team.</p><p>The reason why is that Johnson played both sports while she was going to her alma mater, Stanford.</p><p>The second scholarship, Veronica Meinhard Endowed Scholarship Fund will be for undergraduate students who are first-generation college students.</p><p>This donation is part of Ohio State University's plans to raise a minimum of $800 million in a decade to increase undergraduate scholarships.</p><h2 id=why-did-kristina-johnson->Why Did Kristina Johnson Resign As A Ohio State President?</h2><p>Kristina Johnson has recently announced that she will resign as the president of Ohio State University.</p><p>Kristina has stated that she will step down as president at the end of the academic year.&nbsp;She arrived at the University in August 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was becoming global, and in her two-year tenure has weathered many adversities, with the pandemic being the biggest one.</p><p>Though some wondered if her resignation came at the heels of a request from the board, no one seems to be able to confirm that.</p><p>Other sources have stated that the board knew about Johnson's decision to leave prior to their November meeting.&nbsp;The Board of Trustees chair, Dr. Hiroyuki Fujita, has released a statement from the university thanking Johnson for her time.</p><p>During her short two-year career at the university, she earned over $927,000 as her annual salary.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/11/b78a8ba8-2489-4f43-b68e-ed3875e86ce6.webp></p><p>She has stated that her resignation will take into account the university searching for and finding a new president, and she will stay on until they do so she can help with a seamless transition.</p><p>The board has stated that they will begin searching for the university's 17th president.&nbsp;As for Johnson, she hasn't stated what her next move will be after this job, but only time will tell.</p><p>Given her history in higher education, she might stick to that, or perhaps, given her age, she might choose to retire.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiiq6GjqbavrYyjpqGmo6S7bsPIn5w%3D</p><hr><section
