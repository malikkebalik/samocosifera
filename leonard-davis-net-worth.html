All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Leonard Davis? As of late-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $25.4 million, mostly earned through success in professional football, having played for several teams through his career. As he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Leonard Davis Net Worth $25.4 million</h3><p>Leonard has 21 half-brothers and half-sisters -11 of them were from his father’s previous marriage while his mother had 10 from a previous marriage. His half-brother Charlie Davis also played in the NFL. Leonard attended Wortham High School and during his time there, played football as well as basketball. He led the school’s basketball team to a state championship in 1997. He also received All-American honors and lettered in track. After matriculating, he took an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Austin. He intended to play as a defensive tackle, but was soon moved to the offensive line, and in his last two years played as left tackle. He was a finalist for the Outland Trophy two times, and was a first All-Big 12 selection during his senior year.</p><p>Davis joined the 2001 NFL Draft, and was selected as second overall by the Arizona Cardinals. He became a right guard starter during his rookie season, and then moved to right tackle before returning to a guard position, before in 2004 becoming a left tackle, but struggled in the position.</p><p>He played with the Cardinals until the 2007 season when he became an unrestricted free agent, and subsequently signed a seven year contract with the Dallas Cowboys worth $49.6 million which increased his net worth significantly. The contract was heavily criticized by the media since Davis did not show any spectacular performances to justify the amount, but became the highest paid NFL player. During the year he played as a right guard, and the media was proven wrong when he flourished with Dallas, appearing in the Pro Bowl for three consecutive seasons. During his first season with the Cowboys, the team would win the NFC East Division. He continued to play well in the next few years but was released in 2011 due to a lack of salary cap.</p><p>Leonard then signed a one year deal with the Detroit Lions, but was declared inactive for every game. The following year, he signed a one year deal with the San Francisco 49ers, and the team was able to reach Super Bowl XLVII that year, after which he retired.</p><p>Following retirement, Leonard plays in a heavy metal band called Free Reign in which he is the bassist, with Marc Colombo and Cory Procter – former Cowboys’ teammates – and guitarist Justin Chapman.</p><p>For his personal life, Leonard has been married to Amanda since 2004, and they have two daughters.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.2025316455696><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Leonard Davis</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25.4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 5, 1978</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Wortham, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.98 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>161 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Football player</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>University of Texas at Austin</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Amanda Davis</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Meeya Davis, Mariya Davis</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>L.A.
